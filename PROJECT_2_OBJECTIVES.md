# Revenue Cycle Variance & Denial Intelligence

## Business Objective
The purpose of this project is to identify revenue leakage, denial risk, and payment inefficiencies within the healthcare revenue cycle. The analysis is designed to support leadership decisions related to payer strategy, service line performance, and operational improvement.

## Key Business Questions

1. Which payors have the highest denial rates?
2. Which service lines generate the most denied claims?
3. How does billed revenue compare to paid revenue over time?
4. Where are revenue variances increasing month-over-month?
5. Which combinations of payor and service line represent the highest financial risk?

## Why This Matters
Unidentified denial trends and revenue variance can lead to significant financial losses. This project demonstrates how data analysis can proactively surface risks and support corrective action in revenue cycle operations.
